The topographic maps reveal how neurons carrying out similar computations are organized in the brain. For instance, in the primary visual cortex, neurons preferring similar polar angles and eccentricities are organized in pin-wheel patterns, mapping the external world onto the visual cortex.  

How about the prefrontal cortex (PFC)? PFC supports multiple higher-order cognitive functions, such as working memory, decision making, and motor planning. PFC neurons flexibly adapt their activity according to rules, contextual associations and feedback. Do topographic maps exist in PFC as in visual regions? If so, how do they look like? How are different tasks inter-related in the brain? Addressing these questions will allow us to understand how our brain supports so many higher-order cognitive tasks flexibly.

Computer vision models, such as deep neural networks, can achieve human-level performance in many tasks, e.g. visual classification. Do neural networks and human visual brain regions carry out similar computations? If two objects are represented similarly by a neural network, are they also represented similarly in human brain?

## Compositional representation of tasks in human multipleâ€‘demand cortex

The execution of complex cognitive tasks activates an extensive networks of frontal and parietal regions, known as the multiple-demand (MD) system, whose distributed activity patterns carry information about the task. 

However, the functional organization of task representation remains unclear. Do certain tasks elicit more similar activity patterns than others? If so, what drives the functional organization? 


Computational work suggests that asks may be represented in a compositional fashion in prefrontal cortex, where the representation of a task can be expressed as the algebraic sum of vectors representing the underlying sensory, cognitive and motor processes. 

Empirical evidence for compositional coding is limited. It remains to be tested if this principle generalizes to tasks that require context-dependent decisions.
