Over the years, I developed quite a few hobbies to keep myself entertained. 

I started learning fine arts (sketching objects and figures, painting) since I was in primary school. During grad school, I got into urban sketching, where you take your sketchbook anywhere and depict the scenes. I joined the urban sketching group in Toronto once. It was a blast!
