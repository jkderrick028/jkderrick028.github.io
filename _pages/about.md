## Jinkang (Derrick) Xiang

I am a PhD candidate in computational neuroscience at The University of Western Ontario, Canada, working with Drs. Marieke Mur, Julio Martinez-Trujillo and JÃ¶rn Diedrichsen. 

My research focuses on how prefrontal cortex, the hub of intelligence, supports multiple higher-order cognitive functions flexibly, by analyzing large-scale multitask monkey electrophysiology and human fMRI data using machine learning and statistics. I also develop analytical toolboxes for ML and neuroscience research community. 

Before starting grad school, I finished my BEng in Computer Science and BSc in Mathematics at Sichuan University, China (2016-2020). I spent a semester at Feng Chia University in Taiwan as an exchange student (2018.02-2018.07). 

I am looking for industry jobs or postdoc positions, where I can apply the computational methods to solving real-world challenges or understanding brain functioning. If you have any job offers, please feel free to reach out! 

In my spare time, I enjoy painting, sketching, photography, piano, guitar, traveling, camping, hiking, running, biking, movies and reading. You can find some artwork on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jkderrick028/).
